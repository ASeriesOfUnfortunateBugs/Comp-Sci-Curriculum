# Comp Sci Curriculum

This was the final project in my PHP Programming I class. It was a group project so I worked together with one other student, Christian. The assignment was to create a functioning e-commerce web application for an on-campus computer science bookstore. The requirements are listed below.

* Include a home page
* Include a page for each subject (Programming, Networking, and Cybersecurity)
* Include a cart page
* Include a page for creating accounts and logging in
    * Customers should be able to create an account
    * There should be an admin account
* Include an admin page that is only accessible to the admin account
    * This page should show all current customer holds
* When a customer is signed in to their account, give them a 15% discount to their order
* Order quantities should be editable from the cart page
* You should be able to place an order without charging an account
    * This will place items on reserve for 24 hours
* You should be able to charge an account
    * This will give the option for curb-side pickup

We decided to play to our strengths when dividing up the work for this project. Christian felt good about his front-end design skills, but felt that he struggled when it came to the back-end programming. I felt like my back-end skills were strong so we decided that I would do the PHP portions of the web app while Christian focused on the front-end design and coding. We worked together to brain storm design concepts and color schemes, as well as database design.
