# Comp Sci Curriculum

This was the final project in my PHP Programming I class. It was a group project so I worked together with a fellow student named Christian. The assignment was to create a functioning e-commerce web application for an on-campus computer science bookstore. The requirements are listed below.

* Include a home page
* Include a page for each subject (Programming, Networking, and Cybersecurity)
* Include a cart page
* Include a page for creating accounts and logging in
    * Customers should be able to create an account
    * There should be an admin account
* Include an admin page that is only accessible to the admin account
    * This page should show all current customer holds
* When a customer is signed in to their account, give them a 15% discount to their order
* Order quantities should be editable from the cart page
* You should be able to place an order without charging an account
    * This will place items on reserve for 24 hours
* You should be able to charge an account
    * This will give the option for curb-side pickup

We decided to play to our strengths when dividing up the work for this project. Christian felt good about his front-end design skills, but felt that he struggled when it came to the back-end programming. I felt like my back-end skills were strong. Ultimately, we decided that Christian would work on the front-end design and coding while I would focus on the back-end. We worked together to brain storm design concepts and color schemes, as well as database design.

During our first brainstorming session, we identified what data would need to be stored in the database and what vibe we wanted for the UI. Christian came up with some great design ideas while I prepped a database for our use. Over the course of a few days, we had the database design finalized and a working design for the UI.

Once we completed the planning phase, we moved to the development phase. My focus was primarily on the back-end so I chose the MVC structure to help us keep our files organized. It made sense for us to use this framework since it would help to clearly delineate what files we each needed to be focusing on. It worked out perfectly for this project.
My first goal was to set up the code for the database access, as well as the controller/index page. I wrote all of the functions necessary and set up the index page with a switch designed to load a view depending on the action value. I checked the database connection by adding the PHP code to the menu that would automatically populate menu options based on textbook subjects pulled from the database.
We made sure to stay in contact via voice and text chat throughout the development process. We absolutely could not have succeeded with this project without the kind of communication and openness to discussion that we both shared from day one. We frequently shared where we currently were in the process and kept lists showing what we planned to work on or had finished working on.
As Christian turned in the HTML and CSS he'd been working on, I added whatever PHP was necessary to connect it to the back-end.

As everything began to come together, we both took part in bug testing. We'd had our share of bugs that we encountered during the development process and had managed to keep on top of them so this step was much easier than it could have been. We did have some last minute bugs with our cart system, but we were able to smooth everything out.

Ultimately, this was one of my favorite academic projects. I felt like I learned a lot about collaborative efforts and communicating with others in a software development context. It was definitely a challenge, but I had a lot of fun working with Christian and look back on this experience with pride and fondness. (We got a 100, btw. ðŸ˜‰)
